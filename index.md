First project
-------------

When I realized that I wanted to learn web design, I started a 6 months course in Madrid. As a final project in this course, I did a web page for a friend about psychology and teenagers. This is the page that I did, using HTML5, CSS and JQuery:

<a href="http://www.centro-ayuda-adolescentes.es" target="_blank">Teenagers help centre</a>

Second project
-------------

After that, I discovered Bootstrap and I wanted to create another web page using this framework. Currently I live in Madrid and I like to go for a walk in the city and discover new places, I had the idea to take photographs to some nice buildings in Madrid. This is the result:
