    When I realized that I wanted to learn web design, I decided to do a 6 months course in Madrid. As a final project in this course, I did a web page for a friend about psychology and teenagers. This is the page that I did, using HTML5, CSS and JQuery.

<h2>I lookep up and I saw you, Madrid</h2>

    After that, I discovered Bootstrap and I wanted to create another web page using this framework. Currently I live in Madrid and I like to go for a walk in the city and discover new places, so I had the idea to take photographs to some nice buildings and put them together in a web page. This is the result.

    When I discovered GitHub pages and Jekyll blogs, I thought that a good way to learn it would be to reuse a Jekyll theme for a nice website. As my father wanted to have a place with all his paintings, this was a good opportunity to practise the customization of Jekyll themes. This is the Jekyll theme that I used:
