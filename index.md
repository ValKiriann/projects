First project
-------------

When I realized that I wanted to learn web design, I started a 6 months course in Madrid. As a final project in this course, I did a web page for a friend about psychology and teenagers. This is the page that I did, using HTML5, CSS and JQuery:

<a href="http://www.centro-ayuda-adolescentes.es" target="_blank">Teenagers help centre</a>

Second project
-------------

After that, I discovered Bootstrap and I wanted to create another web page using this framework. Currently I live in Madrid and I like to go for a walk in the city and discover new places, I had the idea to take photographs to some nice buildings in Madrid. This is the result:

Third project
-------------

Now that I have discovered GitHub pages, I want to reuse a Jekyll theme for a nice website. As my father wants to have a site with all his paintings, this is a good opportunity to practise the customization of Jekyll themes. This is the Jekyll theme that I have use:

<a href="http://gridster.digitalmind.ch/" target="_blank">http://gridster.digitalmind.ch/</a>

And this is the website to display all the paintings that my father has done:
