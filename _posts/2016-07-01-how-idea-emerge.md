title: How does a new idea emerge?
date: 2016-07-01

After months of learning things that I don't really need right now, like German or theory of graphic design, I have realized that I am focus now on improving in my career, which is great. But how did I get here?

As Steve Jobs said, "You can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards", so I have looked for the dots in twitter :)

A few months ago I joined the meetup group <a href="http://www.meetup.com/es-ES/Front-end-Developers-Madrid/">Front-end Developers Madrid</a> and I am really glad that I did it because I became aware that I need to learn a lot. I used to send interesting articles and courses to the mailbox of my "future self", but after a while I imagined all the tasks in a wall like in the movie "A beautiful mind" and I shared it in twitter:

I didn't really have a plan to improve in front-end development until a very bad weeks at work when I saw myself unemployed. I had the idea back then (in the shower, where all the ideas come from) to do a talk about moving from back-end to front-end development and take advantage of it to put pressure on me and improve in these months.

I wanted to organize the talk and have all the ideas in the same place and I thought about a Kanban to use different "boxes" for each idea. But after adding some ideas, I started to add also user stories for each thing that I wanted to learn and I realized that it could be very useful to see how a learning goes. 

Those days I saw this tweet:

So I decided to write about each task in my blog and share the idea

What you can learn here is that a bad event can turn in something good and that I like to share in twitter the day 11 of each month, so pay attention to July 11th ;)
