title: Organizing a learning process

When I saw that the <a href="https://www.koliseo.com/codemotion/codemotion-madrid/r4p/5753906952929280/#/" alt="Call for papers Codemotion">Call for papers for Codemotion Madrid 2016</a> process was open, I thought that I should show what I do to help others to do the same process. Right now I struggle to improve as a Frontend Developer, so I think that implementing a learning process can help me and others to improve in this field. The Codemotion conference is in November, so I have 5 months ahead to organize myself to keep improving and show the results there and, of course, here in my blog. If my talk is not chosen, I can still explain this in other meetups or conferences that can be interested and I will improve my skills in between, so I can't lose. 

Organizing tools
-------------

I use 2 types of calendar that I add to a physical board. The first is the usual one, where I write down the meetups/meetings/free time stuff/trips that are outside work. In the second one I write down what I would like to accomplished by month.

The bad thing about the second board is that I don't usually know how many tasks I will accomplish in a month and I would like to reorganize order of tasks in a visual way. 

For that, I am going to start using Kanban with the open source tool <a href="https://taiga.io/" alt="Taiga">Taiga</a>. In the <a href="https://tree.taiga.io/project/cristinafsanz-improving-in-front-end-development/kanban" alt="Kanban Learning Front-end development">learning Front-end development project</a> I will add each task that I would like to accomplish in a user story. In the first version I am adding in the TO-DO column all the tasks, ideas and resources that I have, I don't know if I will separate them in some way to distinguish which kind of task is.

The organization in the Kanban board is the usual in agile methodology, that is, columns TO-DO, DOING and DONE. However, I have add a ADD-TO-BLOG column to add a little explanation, example or conclusion in the blog after finishing doing each task, so other people can take advantage of the time inverted there.


Organizing tasks
-------------

I use Evernote to write about each task that I do, make list of things that I need to do to accomplish it or steps that I will use in the future (for example, steps to upload a new blog post to GitHub). After each task I can get the important parts from there and adding them to the blog.
