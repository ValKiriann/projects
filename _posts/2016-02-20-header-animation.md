For my next web design I want to do something cool, like a header effect on scroll. An example of what I want to achieve is something like this: <a href="http://chrissimpson.co.uk/elasticsearch-yellow-cluster-status-explained.html" alt="Header effect example">Chris Simpson web page</a>, so I looked for a tutorial to get some ideas to do it.

I came across with a tutorial with awesome effects: <a href="http://tympanus.net/codrops/2013/07/16/on-scroll-header-effects/" alt="Tutorial header effects">On scroll header effects</a>. You can download the source code and use it for personal or commercial projects.

For my website I will use the effect of hiding the nav bar on scrolling until the header image disappears and then, fix the nav bar on top of the page.
 
So I will create a first version of the web page with only 2 pages, Home and Blog, to test it. The decision of starting with 2 pages and not only one is to start working with the templates of Jekyll for the nav, header and footer but with a different image in each page.
