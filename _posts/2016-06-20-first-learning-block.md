After organizing the <a href="https://tree.taiga.io/project/cristinafsanz-improving-in-front-end-development/kanban" alt="Kanban Learning Front-end development">learning Front-end development project</a>, I am going to start learning about Preprocessors (Sass for CSS and Jade or HAML for HTML), post-processors (PostCSS) and automatic workflow (with Gulp or Grunt):

After learning this block I will apply the new concepts creating a web design, uploading the code in GitHub and sharing the results in the blog.
