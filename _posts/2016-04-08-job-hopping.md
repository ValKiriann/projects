I didn't know that there is an expression in English for people that change jobs frequently, we don't have any one in Spanish. Maybe is it too frowned upon to be a job hopper that we can't even create one expression for that?  

If you see my CV, you will realize that I have been in 5 companies in 9 years. Maybe it is too much for someone who doesn't know the reasons, but I don't regret my decisions. 

I worked in a big company for 2 years and 5 months and then, I changed my job because I wanted to work abroad. I was a software developer and in my new job I started as a web developer. I learned new technologies, started to practice English everyday, have new experiences in a new country, made new friends and began to learn German in a nice city commuting to work by bike. 

I liked my job as a web developer in a research centre, but I was paid as an intern and I wanted a full-time job. It wasn't easy to find a new job in Germany because of my level of German, but after some months I found another job in the same city. It was a small company (we where 7 people including the 2 CEOs) and they were very patient with my German and I learned to code in a better way in that time.

However, I missed Spain and I decided to come back after my experience abroad. I go on with the same technology in the new company in Spain, and I started to appreciate the importance of communicating with people in my own language, make jokes and relax in the lunchtime (in Germany I was doing a listening/speaking class withouth noticing). I learned a lot from my co-workers in that time and I fell in love with web design through the work of the web designer in that company.

I started to learn web design and I knew that I couldn't work as a web designer in my current company at that time because there were only work for one person, so I looked for another job to become a web designer/frontend developer.

After a year being a frontend developer I am happy with the transition that I have done, I have learnt a lot and I want to keep improving, there are so many things to learn in the front-end side!

And if I look back at the past I am glad that I have worked in different roles, with very different people, in big, medium and small companies and I am more sure now about what I like and what I want from a company:

- It is important that you like what you do everyday, but it is even more important to have a good relationship with your co-workers, to be happy sharing your time with them. 

- It is important that your company helps you to improve, by let you going to conferences, do courses to learn new technologies or improve the ones you have.  

- It is important the company culture, if they allow flexible hours, helps people to balance work-personal life, promote diversity and help underrepresented people to work with them (like women in tech).

- It is important the location: living near your workplace to save time for your life after work or having the possibility of working from home occasionally. 

- It is important to have a good salary and another benefits, like insurance coverage.


If I am in a company that gives me this, maybe it is time to settle down and don't be a job hopper anymore. I have seen a few companies in Spain that offer many of the things of my list, that worry about diversity, conciliation and flexible hours and I will look for them if I look for a job again. 

And there is a project that wants to share where these companies are, it is called <a href="http://www.yosoytumadre.com/empresas_ti_conciliacion/" alt="I am your mother" title="I am your mother">Yo soy tu madre</a>. It is a project for companies in Spain that want to help with balance. At the end everybody wins, because a happy worker is a productive worker.
