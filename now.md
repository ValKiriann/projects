I'm starting a learning process to improve in Front-end development. I have created a <a href="https://tree.taiga.io/project/cristinafsanz-improving-in-front-end-development/kanban">Kanban</a> to organize myself and I will write the process in my <a href="http://cristinafsanz.github.io/projects/blog/">blog</a>. All the resources that I will use in the project will be available in GitHub in a collaborative site like <a href="https://github.com/melanierichards/just-build-websites">Just! Build! Websites!</a>.

After finding some great illustrators like <a href="https://twitter.com/frannerd">Frannerd</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/WheresMyBubble">Debbie Tung</a>, I want to learn the basics of illustration and comics and add some comics in my blog, so I will start with the free online comic course <a href="https://www.kadenze.com/courses/comics-art-in-relationship-ii/info">Comics: Art in relationship</a> in September. Meanwhile I will try doing some comics, painting them with watercolor and adding the texts and captions in Inkscape, thanks to the inspiration of the Youtube tutorial <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofj9w31npF4">Watercolor comics by Wren</a> from <a href="http://wrensart.blogspot.com.es/">Wren Nowan</a>. I will add the resources that I find in another Kanban <a href="https://tree.taiga.io/project/cristinafsanz-resources-learning-illustration/kanban">illustration resources</a>.
